create a directory where you will work on your project . 


let the directory be at /home/user/projects/InterpreterProject where InterpreterProject is the working directory.


BASIC SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
__________________________


1. type cd /home/user/projects/InterpreterProject
2. git init
3. git remote add origin https://github.com/BucketDevelopers/speechtranslator.git
4. git pull origin master
5. type ls to check wether you got the source code.



SETTING UP ECLIPSE AND LIBRARIES (the headache part)
____________________________________________________

1.File -> Import.
2.In Select root directory , give the path as /home/user/projects/InterpreterProject
3.Now Import the project interpreter.( Uncheck Copy into workspace to avoid creating duplicates )

It should give a ! symbol and nothing else at this point on the imported project.

4.Now go to File->Import->Git->Projects From Git->Clone URI

5.In the URI field enter https://github.com/BucketDevelopers/java-speech-api.git
6.Click on next -> make sure both branches ( api-example and master are selected )
7.click next and choose a suitable location other than what you chose before ( ie DONT choose /home/user/projects/InterpreterProject ).
This will help when you want to push changes onto github .

8.Click next -> next -> finish.

9.Now you should have both the necessary projects ( Interpreter and java-speech-api setup )
It should give you error messages on both the projects.

RESOLVING THE ERROR MESSAGES
____________________________

In ECLIPSE

1.go to java-speech-api-git->src->com.darkprograms.speech.recognizer->FlacEncoder.java
2.press ctrl+1 after placing cursor on the error import javaFlacEncoder.FLACEncoder (Basically Quick Fix) 
select Fix Project Setup ... and select Add archive blah blah to the build path.

3.Then go to GoogleResponse.java 
4. In this line private List<String> otherPossibleResponses = new ArrayList<String>(20);
do a quick fix ( Ctrl + 1) on the error.

It should ask you to change project compliance to java 1.5 .. select that.

5.Now finally for the last error. 
Go to project Menu -> properties -> Java Compiler-> Errors/Warning -> check Enable Project Specific Settings.

6.In the deprecated and restricted API , change the setting for forbidden reference to warning from error.

Press Ok . 
Thats it !! 



PROJECT STRUCTURE
_________________

Just so that everyone is clear.

Our main project is Interpreter project.
java-speech-api is just our library project ( J.A.R.V.I.S )

so most of the work will be in interpreter project 

I have divided the interpreter into two packages 

com.bucketdevelopers.Interpreter and com.bucketdevelopers.libs

com.bucketdevelopers.Interpreter will contain most of the real code .

while in com.bucketdevelopers.libs you can create helper classes like Mp3Player etc.

This will make it organised and easy for everyone to debug and understand.



AND if u feel uncomfortable initially to follow the project structure .. u can just place the files and classes randomly . I ll restructure them later. No problems !  :)

Phew! Finally basic intructions Done..
